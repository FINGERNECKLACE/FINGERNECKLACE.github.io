IT TOTALLY DOES. SICK.

GROUND RULES?

"Posts" will be separated by two sequences of underscores (one above and one below each post), each equal in length to my current age at time of writing? Maybe? Should this GitHuBlogging* turn into a long-standing tradition, this formatting rule will very, very slowly get increasingly interesting over time.

I think it would be best to, like the Persian rug-maker, preserve unchanged whatever mistakes or embarrassing bullshit I put here. For as long as GitHub Pages exist, this ever-lengthening page will remain, an unmoving testament to the fact that I did live, once, and I absolutely spoke English.

*I get to name it.
